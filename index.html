        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time in the bustling city of Lima, Peru, there lived a group of teenagers who were not your average high school students. They were determined to empower themselves with knowledge about financial education and make a positive impact on their community. This group consisted of three friends: Keny, Cielo, and Romina.

        Keny was a tech-savvy whiz who had a knack for numbers. Cielo was an aspiring entrepreneur, always full of creative ideas. Romina was an avid reader, constantly seeking knowledge about personal finance.

        One day, the three friends stumbled upon an alarming statistic during their research: the majority of adults in Lima struggled with financial literacy. They realized that if they wanted to make a lasting impact, they needed to start educating their peers about money management from a young age.

        They brainstormed ideas and decided to form a club called "Finance For Dummies." Their mission was to teach teenagers in their school and community about the importance of financial education and provide practical tips for managing money effectively.
